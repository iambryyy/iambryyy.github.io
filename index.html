                    <p class="description"> Hello! My name is Bryan Medina and I am a current
                        senior at California State University, Fullerton majoring in Computer Science.
                        While attending school, I am also feeding my passion for computer science through an online Data Science
                        course through Coursera, as well as working part time at an Apple Store. I am a driven problem solver that
                        enjoys a good challenge - especially if it means honing my skillset while learning something new. As I 
                        prepare to start my career as a Software Engineer, I look forward to applying my knowledge and expertise to 
                        serve as an asset for a greater team so develop and improve creative projects.
                    </p>
