                <p class="description">Hello! My name is Bryan Medina and I am a current senior at California State University, Fullerton majoring in Computer Science. While attending school, I am also feeding my passion for computer science through an online Data Science course through Coursera, as well as working part-time at an Apple Store. I am a driven problem solver that enjoys a good challenge - especially if it means honing my skillset while learning something new. As I prepare to start my career as a Software Engineer, I look forward to applying my knowledge and expertise to serve as an asset for a greater team to develop and improve creative projects.</p>
